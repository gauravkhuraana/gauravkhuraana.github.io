# Welcome to Sharing is Caring! 🎉

Hey there, fellow testing and automation enthusiasts! Welcome to **Sharing is Caring** - your new go-to destination for mastering the art and science of software testing and automation.

<Admonition type="info" title="🚀 What's This All About?">

I have created this site recently and have put all my notes together. Some of it comes from my blog udzial.com
and some from my youtube channel. 

I want my content to be well organised which i was not able to do via [WordPress hosted (udzial.com)](https://udzial.com) or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@Udzial/playlists) or even [GitHub](https://github.com/GauravKhurana).

Even though I write on [Medium](https://medium.com/@gauravkhuraana) as well, there also it's like only posts - we can't organize much.

So here in **blog** portion , i would try to summarise weekly / bi-monthly whats new added in this blog so you can Quickly check this out.
