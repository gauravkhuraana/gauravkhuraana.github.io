# Git Commands

## Untrack Files Locally

When you have files that you modify frequently locally but don't want to commit these changes, you can use Git's `assume-unchanged` feature.

```bash title="Untrack files locally"
# Untrack a file (Git will ignore local changes)
git update-index --assume-unchanged <filenamewithfullpathfromdotgitfolder>

# Track the file again
git update-index --no-assume-unchanged <filenamewithfullpathfromdotgitfolder>

# Example
git update-index --assume-unchanged datafile.properties
```

## Revert a Wrong Branch Pull

If you've pulled the wrong branch and want to revert it, follow these 4 steps:

```bash title="Revert wrong branch pull"
# Step 1: Check the commit history
git log

# Look for the commit hash of the state you want to revert to 
# (usually, this is the one just before the pull)

# Step 2: Reset your branch to the desired commit
git reset --hard <commit_hash>

# Step 3: Clean up any new files introduced by the pull
git clean -f

# Step 4: Verify the status
git status
```

:::tip
Always double-check the commit hash before running `git reset --hard` as this operation cannot be easily undone.
