## 🎯 Key Reasons Companies Want Performance Testing Skills

### 1. **Full-Stack Testing Capabilities**
Companies want testers who can handle both functional automation and performance testing, making teams more efficient and reducing hiring needs.

### 2. **DevOps & CI/CD Integration**
Performance tests need to be automated in CI/CD pipelines just like functional tests, requiring similar automation skills and mindset.

### 3. **Early Performance Feedback**
Modern development practices require performance testing earlier in the development cycle, integrated with functional test automation.

### 4. **Cost Efficiency**
Hiring one person who can do both functional and performance testing is more cost-effective than hiring separate specialists.

### 5. **Scripting & Programming Skills**
Both functional automation and performance testing require similar programming and scripting abilities, making the transition natural.
