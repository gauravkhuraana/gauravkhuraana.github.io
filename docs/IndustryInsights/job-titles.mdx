## What Should You Call Yourself?

### Consider These Factors

1. **Your actual work** - What do you do daily?

3. **Your goals** - Where do you want to grow?
4. **Market demand** - What do employers search for?
5. **Your comfort** - What feels authentic?

### My Recommendation

Focus less on the perfect title and more on:
- **Skills you're building**
- **Impact you're creating**
- **Value you're delivering**
- **Growth you're achieving**

The best "title" is being known as someone who:
- Delivers quality results
- Solves problems effectively
- Continuously learns and improves
- Helps others succeed
