# Effective Communication: Beyond Hello

## Please Do Not Stop at Hi or Hello

It wastes both of our time. I might say hello later and then wait for your message.

Instead, after hi or hello, include your actual question or information you want to share.

I will reply as soon as I am free.

I am not trying to be rude but trying to save time and be productive.

## The Problem

**Inefficient**:
```
You: Hi
Me: Hello, how can I help?
You: I have a question about API testing...
Me: [Finally gives answer]
```

**Better**:
```
You: Hi Gaurav, I have a question about API testing. 
How do you handle authentication in Postman?
Me: [Direct answer]
```

## Why This Works

- **Saves time** for both parties
- **Provides context** immediately
- **Gets faster responses**
- **Shows respect** for time
