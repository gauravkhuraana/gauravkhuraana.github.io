## ðŸ“‹ Core Time Management Strategies

### 1. Daily Planning & Prioritization
- **Plan your day ahead**: Schedule tasks the night before or first thing in the morning
- **Focus & prioritize wisely**: Analyze risks and impact to determine task order
- **Set time limits**: Use timeboxing to prevent tasks from expanding unnecessarily
- **Remove non-essential tasks**: Eliminate activities that don't add value

### 2. Task Management Techniques
- **Break down large tasks**: Divide complex work into smaller, manageable chunks for better visibility and achievability
- **Use risk-based prioritization**: Focus on high-risk areas first
- **Schedule daily tasks**: Use your calendar as a commitment tool, not just a reminder

## ðŸ§  Energy Management Over Time Management

Instead of just managing time, focus on **energy management skills**:

### Master the Art of Focus
- **Stay connected to the current moment**
- **Practice attentive concentration**
- **Learn to optimize your energy levels throughout the day**

An intelligent mind is a master in the art of focusing and knowing how to optimize energy effectively.

## ðŸ’¡ Daily Success Framework

Follow this simple framework every day:

### Morning Setup
1. **Identify three key things** you want to accomplish today
2. **Determine what resources** you need to monitor and complete these tasks
3. **Prioritize them** based on urgency and importance
4. **Review and adjust** your plan as needed

### Evening Review
- **Evaluate your overall accomplishment** of the day
- **Reflect on what worked** and what didn't
- **Plan adjustments** for tomorrow
- **Practice this habit** consistently every day

## ðŸš¨ When You Feel Overwhelmed

### Common Signs

4. **Step away from your desk** - Change your physical environment
5. **Abandon the task temporarily** - Sometimes the best solution is to stop
