## Core Bug Reporting Principles

### 1. Ensure Reproducibility

Before reporting any bug, ensure you can consistently reproduce it:

- Test the scenario 2-3 times to verify reproducibility
- Rule out external factors (network issues, browser cache, user error)
- Avoid unnecessary back-and-forth communication with developers

### 2. Write Clear, Detailed Descriptions

- Write comprehensive descriptions that any team member can understand
- Avoid one-liner bug reports
- Treat bug documentation as a critical task

### 3. Include Supporting Evidence

#### Visual Documentation
- **Screenshots**: Capture relevant UI elements and error states
- **Screen recordings**: Show the exact user flow leading to the bug

#### Technical Logs
- **Test execution logs**: Essential for non-reproducible bugs
- **Network logs**: Include API calls and responses
- **System information**: OS, browser version, device specifications
- **Application logs**: Error messages and stack traces

#### Test Environment Details
- **Test data**: Document exact input values used
- **System configuration**: Include all relevant environment settings

### 4. Conduct Root Cause Analysis

- Investigate potential causes before reporting
- For critical bugs (S1/S2), perform mandatory RCA
- Consider environment factors and potential impact on other features

### 5. Apply Risk-Based Prioritization

- Assess real-world occurrence likelihood
- Evaluate business impact and user experience effects
- Prioritize high-probability issues that users will encounter

## Best Practices for Team Success

- **Follow to Resolution**: Track bug progress until conclusion
- **Professional Communication**: Focus on technical issues, not individuals
- **Early Detection**: Identify bugs early to reduce fix costs
- **Team Culture**: Encourage reporting from all team members
- **Value Quality**: Recognize high-impact bug discoveries
