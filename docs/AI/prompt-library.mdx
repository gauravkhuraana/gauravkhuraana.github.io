# Prompt Library for Testing & Automation

This comprehensive prompt library contains carefully crafted AI prompts designed specifically for software testing and automation professionals. These prompts are optimized for use with AI tools like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Claude, and other AI assistants to enhance your productivity and code quality.

## Test Automation Framework Development

import YouTubeEmbed from '@site/src/components/YouTubeEmbed';

### Selenium WebDriver Framework Creation

Use this prompt to generate a complete, production-ready test automation framework using Selenium WebDriver and Java.

**Prompt:**

```
Create a modern, scalable, and modular test automation framework using Java 11 or above and Selenium WebDriver that supports cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

Key requirements:
• Use TestNG as the test runner
• Follow Page Object Model (POM) design pattern
• Use Maven for build management
• Implement logging (e.g., Log4j or SLF4J) and reporting (e.g., Extent Reports or Allure or both)
• Parallel test execution support for local and remote tests
• A Base Test setup that initializes browser and platform based on config
• Add a pipeline using Github actions and a it should generate a link to allure and extent report
• README and sample tests to show usage
• Test Data should be separate from logic
• Make it compatible with running on Lambdatest platform
• google.com - this site should be used as a sample site for which test should be written

Add these test scenarios (excluding login scenarios):
• A test to check if none of the links are broken
• A test to check if number of images on screen are more than 1
• Write 3-4 tests for the search engine functionality where some should fail and some should pass
```

### Playwright TypeScript Framework Creation

Use this prompt to generate a complete, production-ready test automation framework using Playwright with TypeScript.

**Prompt:**

```
Create a modern, scalable, and modular test automation framework using Playwright with TypeScript that supports cross-browser testing (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)

✅ Core Framework Requirements:
• Use Playwright's built-in test runner with TypeScript
• Follow Page Object Model (POM) design pattern with fixtures for dependency injection
• Use npm/yarn for package management
• Implement comprehensive logging and reporting (Playwright HTML Reporter, Allure, and custom reporters)
• Parallel test execution support with worker-based parallelization
• Custom fixtures for browser setup, page initialization, and test data management
• Base test fixtures that initialize browser context and pages based on configuration
• Add CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions with artifact publishing for reports
• README with comprehensive documentation and sample test usage
• Test data externalization using JSON/YAML files and environment-based configuration
• Docker support for containerized test execution
• Integration with Selenium grid and cloud testing platforms (BrowserStack, lambdatest)
• Do not miss important files like gitignore
• Use google.com as the sample application under test

✅ Fixture Requirements:
• Browser fixture for cross-browser testing setup
• Page fixture extending browser fixture for page-specific operations
• Test data fixture for loading external test data
• API fixture for API testing capabilities
• Custom fixtures for common test utilities (screenshots, video recording, etc.)

✅ Test Scenarios to implement:
• A test to validate no broken links exist on the page (should pass)
• A test to verify the number of images on screen exceeds a threshold (should pass)
• Search functionality tests (3-4 scenarios):
  - Valid search with results verification (should pass)
  - Search with special characters handling (should pass)
  - Search with extremely long query (should fail intentionally)
  - Search result pagination test (should fail intentionally for demo)

✅ Advanced Features:
• Visual regression testing capabilities using Playwright's screenshot comparison
• API testing integration for end-to-end workflows
• Mobile/responsive testing support with device emulation
• Accessibility testing integration
• Performance testing hooks (Core Web Vitals)
• Multi-environment configuration (dev, staging, prod)
• Custom retry mechanisms and flaky test handling
• Integration with test management tools
• Dockerized execution environment
• Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)

✅ Reporting & CI/CD:
• Generate and publish HTML reports, Allure reports, and JUnit XML
• GitHub Actions workflow with matrix strategy for cross-browser testing
• Artifact storage for test results, screenshots, and videos
• Slack/Teams notifications for test results
• Report hosting with GitHub Pages or similar
• Test trend analysis and metrics collection

This framework should demonstrate modern testing practices with Playwright's powerful features like auto-waiting, network interception, and built-in assertions while maintaining enterprise-grade scalability and maintainability.
```

## Framework Enhancement Prompts

### API Testing Integration

```

• API base classes and utilities
• JSON schema validation
• Response time assertions
• Data-driven API tests
• Integration with existing reporting
```

### Mobile Testing Addition

```
Add mobile testing capabilities to the existing framework using Appium. Include:
• Mobile driver management for iOS and Android
• Mobile page objects
• Device configuration management
• Cross-platform test execution
• Cloud device integration (Lambdatest / BrowserStack)
```

### REST API Automation Framework Creation

Use this prompt to generate a complete, production-ready API automation framework using REST Assured and Java.

**Prompt:**

```
Create a modern, scalable, and modular API automation framework in Java (Java 17 or 21) using Rest Assured and JUnit as the test runner.

The framework should include the following features:

✅ Supported HTTP Methods
Implement API request support for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH methods.

✅ Authentication Support
Support multiple authentication types:
• Bearer token
• API key
• Basic auth
• Support for setting headers dynamically from properties files or environment.

✅ Serialization / Deserialization
Use POJOs and Jackson/Gson libraries for request payload creation and response parsing.

✅ Framework Structure
Modular folder structure with separation of concerns:
• config, utils, testdata, models, tests, reporting, etc.
• Environment configuration management via .properties or .yaml files.
• Test data management via JSON.

✅ Execution & CI/CD
• Compatible with GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps Pipelines.
• Configurable test execution using Maven profiles or environment tags.

✅ Reporting
• Integrate Extent Reports or Allure Reports for detailed HTML reports.
• Include request/response logs, steps (for failure scenarios).

✅ Logging & Debugging
• Integrate log4j2 or SLF4J for detailed logs.
• Add logs for request/response, headers, and exceptions.
• Enable easy debugging and verbose logs when needed.

✅ Error Handling & Retry Logic
• Add a robust exception handling mechanism.
• Implement retry logic for flaky requests using a custom annotation or Rest Assured filters.

✅ Parallel Execution
Enable parallel execution of tests using JUnit parallel configuration or Maven Surefire plugin.

✅ Docker Support
• Provide a Dockerfile to run the test framework in containers.
• Use a docker-compose.yml file (optional) for service dependencies like mock servers or test APIs.

✅ Test Suites & Tagging
• Organize tests into suites (e.g., smoke, regression, auth tests).
• Use tags/annotations for running specific groups.

✅ Documentation
Provide a README.md with:
• Prerequisites
• Project structure explanation
• How to add a new test case
• How to run tests locally, in Docker, or via pipeline
• Sample command-line usages (e.g., mvn clean test -Denv=qa)

✅ Bonus (Optional Enhancements)
• Integrate with Postman or Swagger to import existing APIs if needed.
• Include utility to generate curl or HAR from failed tests for debugging.
• Add sample validations like status code, headers, response body match.
• Use JSONPath or similar libraries for complex JSON response validation.
• Add data-driven testing capabilities with CSV/Excel support.
