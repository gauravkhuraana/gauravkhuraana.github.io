## Website Quality Analysis Prompts

### Comprehensive Website Testing with AI

Use this expert-level prompt to perform thorough website analysis with zero false positives. This prompt enforces strict verification rules and provides detailed, actionable reports.

**Prompt:**

```
You are an expert software tester and QA analyst (14+ years). Your job is to analyze this webpage: [INSERT URL] and report only confirmed issues — no false positives.

Spelling & Grammar:
• Rule-based spellcheck (dictionary lookup) on the exact visible text.
• Contextual grammar check using your language model.
→ Confirm if both flag the same text as wrong OR if the grammar check flags an actual meaning change. Provide text diff, correction suggestion, and element XPath.

Accessibility (A11y):
• Run an automated scan (axe-core or Lighthouse accessibility).
• Perform a keyboard navigation check (simulate Tab/Shift+Tab) or verify missing ARIA/alt attributes in DOM.
→ Confirm if (1) any rule fails AND (2) the element is missing attributes or keyboard focus fails. Attach rule id and axe/Lighthouse snippet.

UI (Visual Design) / Layout:
• Compute element bounding boxes (getBoundingClientRect) and check overlap/intersection ratio.
• Snapshot visual viewport; compare where overlap/overflow occurs across two viewport widths (desktop & mobile).
→ Confirm if bounding box intersection > 15% (or text cut-off) on at least two viewports/reloads. Attach screenshots and bounding-box coords + XPath.

UX / Usability:
• Perform the key user flow(s) (e.g., signup → confirm).
• Check microcopy, CTA clarity, or error messages for ambiguity (language model check).
→ Confirm if user cannot complete flow or error messages lack actionable guidance across 2 attempts. Provide steps, expected vs actual, and screenshots.

Functional:
• Execute the UI action. Observe the network/XHR response and console logs.
• Validate the actual behavior (navigation/state) against expected outcome.
→ Confirm if the network response is error (HTTP >=400) and/or console error occurs AND the UI behavior is incorrect on 2 attempts. Provide endpoint, status, request/response snippet, console stack trace, XPath.

Performance:
• Run a Lighthouse/performance audit or measure TTFB, FCP, LCP, TBT.
• Check network waterfall for long blocking resources or repeatedly slow XHR calls.
→ Confirm if thresholds exceeded on 2 runs (default thresholds: LCP>2.5s, TBT>300ms, TTI>5s) or same XHR >2s on 2 attempts. Attach timings and waterfall snippet.

Security:
• Inspect for mixed content / insecure HTTP calls in Network tab.
• Inspect response headers set for cookies (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite) and any tokens in JS strings.
→ Confirm if insecure calls exist on 2 reloads or if cookies lack Secure/HttpOnly where expected. Provide network entries and header snippets.

API / Background Calls:
• Filter XHR/fetch and repeat the user action to re-trigger calls twice.
• Confirm failing responses repeat with same HTTP error or payload.
→ Confirm if two consecutive attempts return error or malformed payload. Include request payload, response body, endpoint, status and timestamp.

SEO / Metadata:
• View page source for meta tags (title, description, canonical).
• Run Lighthouse SEO audit.
→ Confirm if meta is missing or mismatched in source and Lighthouse flags it.

Cross-Browser / Mobile:
• Simulate user agent / rendering differences (if browser environment supports); reload and verify.
• If multi-browser simulation isn't available, mark as Unverified and list exact manual steps to run (or request a BrowserStack session).

```

**Usage Example:**

Replace `[INSERT URL]` with the actual website URL you want to test:

```
You are an expert software tester and QA analyst (14+ years). Your job is to analyze this webpage: https://www.example.com and report only confirmed issues — no false positives.
[... rest of the prompt ...]
