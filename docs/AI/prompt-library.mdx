# Prompt Library for Testing & Automation

This comprehensive prompt library contains carefully crafted AI prompts designed specifically for software testing and automation professionals. These prompts are optimized for use with AI tools like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Claude, and other AI assistants to enhance your productivity and code quality.

## Test Automation Framework Development

### Selenium WebDriver Framework Creation

Use this prompt to generate a complete, production-ready test automation framework using Selenium WebDriver and Java.

**Prompt:**

```
Create a modern, scalable, and modular test automation framework using Java 11 or above and Selenium WebDriver that supports cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

Key requirements:
• Use TestNG as the test runner
• Follow Page Object Model (POM) design pattern
• Use Maven for build management
• Implement logging (e.g., Log4j or SLF4J) and reporting (e.g., Extent Reports or Allure or both)
• Parallel test execution support for local and remote tests
• A Base Test setup that initializes browser and platform based on config
• README and sample tests to show usage
• Test Data should be separate from logic
• Make it compatible with running on Lambdatest platform
• google.com - this site should be used as a sample site for which test should be written

Add these test scenarios (excluding login scenarios):
• A test to check if none of the links are broken
• A test to check if number of images on screen are more than 1
• Write 3-4 tests for the search engine functionality where some should fail and some should pass
```

**Best Use Cases:**
- Starting a new automation project from scratch
- Modernizing legacy test frameworks
- Creating standardized testing solutions for teams
- Building frameworks for cross-browser compatibility

**Expected Output:**
- Complete Maven project structure
- Page Object Model implementation
- Base test classes with browser management
- Configuration files for different environments
- Sample test cases with assertions
- Comprehensive documentation

## Framework Enhancement Prompts

### API Testing Integration

```
Extend the existing Selenium framework to include REST API testing capabilities using RestAssured. Include:
• API base classes and utilities
• JSON schema validation
• Response time assertions
• Data-driven API tests
• Integration with existing reporting
```

### Mobile Testing Addition

```
Add mobile testing capabilities to the existing framework using Appium. Include:
• Mobile driver management for iOS and Android
• Mobile page objects
• Device configuration management
• Cross-platform test execution
• Cloud device integration (Lambdatest / BrowserStack)
```

## Test Case Generation Prompts

### Comprehensive Test Scenarios

```
Generate comprehensive test scenarios for [APPLICATION_TYPE] covering:
• Functional testing scenarios
• Edge cases and boundary conditions
• Negative test cases
• Performance considerations
• Accessibility requirements
• Cross-browser compatibility checks
```

### Data-Driven Test Creation

```
Create data-driven test cases for [FEATURE_NAME] that include:
• Multiple test data sets in Excel/CSV format
• Parameterized test methods
• Test data validation
• Expected vs actual result comparison
• Detailed test reporting with data sets
```

## Code Review & Quality Prompts

### Code Quality Analysis

```
Review this test automation code for:
• Best practices adherence
• Code maintainability
• Performance optimization opportunities
• Security considerations
• Documentation quality
• Potential flaky test patterns
```

### Test Maintenance

```
Analyze these test cases for maintenance improvements:
• Identify duplicate code patterns
• Suggest refactoring opportunities
• Recommend better locator strategies
• Propose wait strategy improvements
• Suggest reporting enhancements
```

## Debugging & Troubleshooting Prompts

### Test Failure Analysis

```
Analyze this test failure and provide:
• Root cause analysis
• Potential fixes
• Prevention strategies
• Improved error handling
• Better assertion messages
• Debugging recommendations
```

### Performance Optimization

```
Optimize this test automation code for:
• Faster test execution
• Reduced flakiness
• Better resource utilization
• Improved parallel execution
• Memory optimization
• Network call efficiency
```

## Documentation Prompts

### README Generation

```
Create a comprehensive README for this test automation project including:
• Project overview and architecture
• Setup and installation instructions
• Configuration guide
• Test execution commands
• Reporting and results interpretation
• Troubleshooting guide
• Contributing guidelines
```

### Test Plan Documentation

```
Generate a detailed test plan document for [PROJECT_NAME] including:
• Test strategy and approach
• Scope and objectives
• Test environment requirements
• Risk assessment
• Timeline and deliverables
• Success criteria
```

## Usage Tips

### Customizing Prompts

1. **Replace placeholders** like [APPLICATION_TYPE] with specific details
2. **Add context** about your current tech stack and requirements
3. **Specify constraints** like timeline, team size, or technology limitations
4. **Include examples** of existing code or patterns you prefer

### Iterative Refinement

1. **Start with basic prompts** and gradually add complexity
2. **Provide feedback** to the AI about what works and what doesn't
3. **Ask for alternatives** when the first solution doesn't fit your needs
4. **Request explanations** for generated code to improve understanding

### Best Practices

- Always review and test generated code before implementation
- Adapt prompts to match your organization's coding standards
- Keep prompts updated with latest testing trends and technologies
- Share successful prompts with your team for consistency
