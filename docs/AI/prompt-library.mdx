## Test Automation Framework Development

import YouTubeEmbed from '@site/src/components/YouTubeEmbed';

### Selenium WebDriver Framework Creation

Use this prompt to generate a complete, production-ready test automation framework using Selenium WebDriver and Java.

**Prompt:**

```
Create a modern, scalable, and modular test automation framework using Java 11 or above and Selenium WebDriver that supports cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

Key requirements:
• Use TestNG as the test runner
• Follow Page Object Model (POM) design pattern
• Use Maven for build management
• Implement logging (e.g., Log4j or SLF4J) and reporting (e.g., Extent Reports or Allure or both)
• Parallel test execution support for local and remote tests
• A Base Test setup that initializes browser and platform based on config
• Add a pipeline using Github actions and a it should generate a link to allure and extent report
• README and sample tests to show usage
• Test Data should be separate from logic
• Make it compatible with running on Lambdatest platform
• google.com - this site should be used as a sample site for which test should be written

Add these test scenarios (excluding login scenarios):
• A test to check if none of the links are broken
• A test to check if number of images on screen are more than 1
• Write 3-4 tests for the search engine functionality where some should fail and some should pass
```

### Playwright TypeScript Framework Creation

Use this prompt to generate a complete, production-ready test automation framework using Playwright with TypeScript.

**Prompt:**

```
Create a modern, scalable, and modular test automation framework using Playwright with TypeScript that supports cross-browser testing (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)

✅ Core Framework Requirements:
• Use Playwright's built-in test runner with TypeScript
• Follow Page Object Model (POM) design pattern with fixtures for dependency injection
• Use npm/yarn for package management
• Implement comprehensive logging and reporting (Playwright HTML Reporter, Allure, and custom reporters)
• Parallel test execution support with worker-based parallelization
• Custom fixtures for browser setup, page initialization, and test data management
• Base test fixtures that initialize browser context and pages based on configuration
• Add CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions with artifact publishing for reports
• README with comprehensive documentation and sample test usage
• Test data externalization using JSON/YAML files and environment-based configuration
• Docker support for containerized test execution
• Integration with Selenium grid and cloud testing platforms (BrowserStack, lambdatest)
• Do not miss important files like gitignore
• Use google.com as the sample application under test

✅ Fixture Requirements:
• Browser fixture for cross-browser testing setup
• Page fixture extending browser fixture for page-specific operations
• Test data fixture for loading external test data
• API fixture for API testing capabilities
• Custom fixtures for common test utilities (screenshots, video recording, etc.)

✅ Test Scenarios to implement:
• A test to validate no broken links exist on the page (should pass)
• A test to verify the number of images on screen exceeds a threshold (should pass)
• Search functionality tests (3-4 scenarios):
  - Valid search with results verification (should pass)
  - Search with special characters handling (should pass)
  - Search with extremely long query (should fail intentionally)
  - Search result pagination test (should fail intentionally for demo)

✅ Advanced Features:
• Visual regression testing capabilities using Playwright's screenshot comparison
• API testing integration for end-to-end workflows
• Mobile/responsive testing support with device emulation
• Accessibility testing integration
• Performance testing hooks (Core Web Vitals)
• Multi-environment configuration (dev, staging, prod)
• Custom retry mechanisms and flaky test handling
• Integration with test management tools
• Dockerized execution environment
• Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)

✅ Reporting & CI/CD:
• Generate and publish HTML reports, Allure reports, and JUnit XML
• GitHub Actions workflow with matrix strategy for cross-browser testing
• Artifact storage for test results, screenshots, and videos
• Slack/Teams notifications for test results
• Report hosting with GitHub Pages or similar
• Test trend analysis and metrics collection

This framework should demonstrate modern testing practices with Playwright's powerful features like auto-waiting, network interception, and built-in assertions while maintaining enterprise-grade scalability and maintainability.

## Website Quality Analysis Prompts

### Comprehensive Website Testing with AI

Use this expert-level prompt to perform thorough website analysis with zero false positives. This prompt enforces strict verification rules and provides detailed, actionable reports.

**Prompt:**

```
You are an expert software tester and QA analyst (14+ years). Your job is to analyze this webpage: [INSERT URL] and report only confirmed issues — no false positives.

Spelling & Grammar:
• Rule-based spellcheck (dictionary lookup) on the exact visible text.
• Contextual grammar check using your language model.
→ Confirm if both flag the same text as wrong OR if the grammar check flags an actual meaning change. Provide text diff, correction suggestion, and element XPath.

Accessibility (A11y):
• Run an automated scan (axe-core or Lighthouse accessibility).
• Perform a keyboard navigation check (simulate Tab/Shift+Tab) or verify missing ARIA/alt attributes in DOM.
→ Confirm if (1) any rule fails AND (2) the element is missing attributes or keyboard focus fails. Attach rule id and axe/Lighthouse snippet.

UI (Visual Design) / Layout:
• Compute element bounding boxes (getBoundingClientRect) and check overlap/intersection ratio.
• Snapshot visual viewport; compare where overlap/overflow occurs across two viewport widths (desktop & mobile).
→ Confirm if bounding box intersection > 15% (or text cut-off) on at least two viewports/reloads. Attach screenshots and bounding-box coords + XPath.

UX / Usability:
• Perform the key user flow(s) (e.g., signup → confirm).
• Check microcopy, CTA clarity, or error messages for ambiguity (language model check).
→ Confirm if user cannot complete flow or error messages lack actionable guidance across 2 attempts. Provide steps, expected vs actual, and screenshots.

Functional:
• Execute the UI action. Observe the network/XHR response and console logs.
• Validate the actual behavior (navigation/state) against expected outcome.
→ Confirm if the network response is error (HTTP >=400) and/or console error occurs AND the UI behavior is incorrect on 2 attempts. Provide endpoint, status, request/response snippet, console stack trace, XPath.

Performance:
• Run a Lighthouse/performance audit or measure TTFB, FCP, LCP, TBT.
• Check network waterfall for long blocking resources or repeatedly slow XHR calls.
→ Confirm if thresholds exceeded on 2 runs (default thresholds: LCP>2.5s, TBT>300ms, TTI>5s) or same XHR >2s on 2 attempts. Attach timings and waterfall snippet.

Security:
• Inspect for mixed content / insecure HTTP calls in Network tab.
• Inspect response headers set for cookies (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite) and any tokens in JS strings.
→ Confirm if insecure calls exist on 2 reloads or if cookies lack Secure/HttpOnly where expected. Provide network entries and header snippets.

API / Background Calls:
• Filter XHR/fetch and repeat the user action to re-trigger calls twice.
• Confirm failing responses repeat with same HTTP error or payload.
→ Confirm if two consecutive attempts return error or malformed payload. Include request payload, response body, endpoint, status and timestamp.

SEO / Metadata:
• View page source for meta tags (title, description, canonical).
• Run Lighthouse SEO audit.
→ Confirm if meta is missing or mismatched in source and Lighthouse flags it.

Cross-Browser / Mobile:
• Simulate user agent / rendering differences (if browser environment supports); reload and verify.
• If multi-browser simulation isn't available, mark as Unverified and list exact manual steps to run (or request a BrowserStack session).

```

**Usage Example:**

Replace `[INSERT URL]` with the actual website URL you want to test:

```
You are an expert software tester and QA analyst (14+ years). Your job is to analyze this webpage: https://www.example.com and report only confirmed issues — no false positives.
