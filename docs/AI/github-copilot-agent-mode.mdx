# GitHub Copilot Agent Mode - Let's learn

## Introduction

Welcome to the future of software development! In this blog, we'll dive deep into GitHub Copilot's newest and smartest offering — Agent Mode. Think of it not just as a code completion tool, but a true AI Agent that understands your goals, takes actions in your development environment, and helps you get things done with minimal effort.

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this guide will show you how Agent Mode stands apart from Copilot's Chat and Edit modes, how it works with tools like Playwright, and how to make the most out of it.

## What is GitHub Copilot Agent Mode?

GitHub Copilot Agent Mode is a game-changing feature that brings automation, intelligence, and autonomy to your VS Code editor. Unlike traditional AI tools that offer suggestions or generate snippets, Agent Mode acts like a virtual assistant capable of understanding commands, editing files, installing packages, running tests, and more — all within your IDE.

### Key Abilities of an AI Agent:

- **Acts on the environment** (like installing Playwright)
- **Reasons through problems** (e.g., handling test failures)
- **Makes decisions** (e.g., choosing the right config or language)

## Comparison of Modes: Ask vs Edit vs Agent

| Mode | What It Does | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Ask Mode** | Similar to ChatGPT; gives textual answers and suggestions | Understanding concepts (e.g., npm vs npx) |
| **Edit Mode** | Modifies files directly, adds tests or configurations | Creating JSON files, editing tests |
| **Agent Mode** | Does everything: installs tools, edits files, runs commands | Full-fledged task automation |

## Real Use Case: Creating a Playwright Test with Agent Mode

### Install Prerequisites:
- Download VS Code
- Install GitHub Copilot and Copilot Chat extensions

### Setup Your Project:
- Create a folder like `PlaywrightWithAgent`
- Open the folder in VS Code and activate Agent Mode

### Give a Prompt:
**Example:** "Create a Playwright test to open gauravkhurana.in and run it."

### Observe the Magic:
- Files like `package.json` and `playwright.config.ts` are generated
- Agent runs commands like `npm install`, `npx playwright install`
- Tests run automatically, screenshots and videos are captured

### Debugging & Understanding:
- Agent Mode explains failures and suggests fixes
- Generates detailed reports with passed/failed test summaries

## Analogy to Remember:

- **Ask Mode** is like a mentor: gives advice
- **Edit Mode** is like a friend: helps out
- **Agent Mode** is like a smart assistant: gets things done on its own

## Why Agent Mode is the Future

- **Reduced Setup Time:** No need to Google dependencies or file structures
- **Error Recovery:** Handles exceptions and provides solutions
- **Autonomous Coding:** Executes tasks with real-time feedback
