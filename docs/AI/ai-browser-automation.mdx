# ðŸ¤– AI Browser Automation

Discover how **AI is transforming browser automation** and web testing. Learn advanced techniques for creating intelligent, self-healing test automation that adapts to UI changes and provides smarter element detection and interaction strategies.

## Sample AI Prompts for Browser Automation

Here are some practical AI prompts you can use for browser automation tasks:

### WhatsApp Group Cleanup Prompt

This prompt can be used with AI-powered browser automation tools to automatically clean up WhatsApp groups based on specific naming patterns.

```
Delete all media and chat from the groups which have the following words in their name:
- Family 
- GEIT
```
OR 
```
Delete all media and chat from the archived groups
```

### Smart Locator Generation Prompts

These enhanced prompts will help you generate robust, maintainable locators for different automation frameworks:

#### Playwright Locator Generation
```
Analyze this webpage and generate Playwright locators using best practices:
- Use getByRole() for interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs)
- Use getByLabel() for form fields with labels
- Use getByTestId() for elements with test-id attributes
- Use getByText() for unique text content
- Provide fallback locators using getByLocator() for complex elements
- Include both positive and negative assertions where applicable
- Format as TypeScript Page Object Model methods

Focus on user-centric locators that are resilient to UI changes.
```

#### Selenium WebDriver Locator Scripts
```
Generate Selenium WebDriver locators for this page and create a complete Page Object class:
- Use By.id() for elements with unique IDs
- Use By.name() for form elements with name attributes
- Use By.linkText() and By.partialLinkText() for links
- Use By.xpath() only when necessary, prefer CSS selectors
- Include WebDriverWait conditions for dynamic elements
- Add proper error handling and logging
- Format as Java/Python/C# Page Object Pattern
- Include common actions like click(), sendKeys(), getText()

Generate both individual locators and complete interaction methods.
```

#### Cross-Browser Compatible Locators
```
Create cross-browser compatible locators for this webpage:
- Generate CSS selectors that work across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- Avoid browser-specific pseudo-selectors
- Use stable attributes (data-testid, role, aria-label)
- Provide multiple locator strategies for critical elements
- Include mobile-responsive locator alternatives
- Test locator uniqueness and stability
- Format as JSON object with element descriptions

Prioritize accessibility attributes and semantic HTML elements.
```

#### Section-Specific Locator Generation
```
Generate locators specifically for the [SECTION_NAME] section of this page:
- Identify the container element for the section
- Map all interactive elements within this section
- Use relative locators from the section container
- Include data validation locators for dynamic content
- Generate both individual element and collection locators
- Provide methods for section-level operations (expand, collapse, filter)
- Format as [FRAMEWORK] Page Object methods with clear naming conventions

Example: For "Candidates" section, include locators for candidate cards, filters, pagination, and search functionality.
```

#### AI-Enhanced Locator Strategies
```
Analyze this webpage and suggest intelligent locator strategies:
- Identify elements likely to change frequently (dynamic IDs, generated classes)
- Recommend stable alternatives using semantic attributes
- Suggest data-testid placement for untestable elements
- Generate locators with built-in retry mechanisms
- Include accessibility-compliant alternatives
- Provide locator health scoring based on stability factors
- Suggest page structure improvements for better testability

Create self-healing locator patterns that can adapt to minor UI changes.
```

#### Framework-Specific Advanced Prompts

**For Playwright with Modern Web Apps:**
```
Generate Playwright locators for this SPA/React/Angular application:
- Use page.locator() with chaining for complex scenarios
- Include page.waitForSelector() for dynamic content
- Generate locators for shadow DOM elements if present
- Use page.frameLocator() for iframe content
- Include network request interception patterns
- Provide locators for handling loading states and animations
- Format with proper async/await patterns and error handling

Include performance-optimized selectors and parallel execution strategies.
```

**For Selenium with Dynamic Content:**
```
Create robust Selenium locators for this dynamic webpage:
- Generate explicit waits for all interactive elements
- Include retry mechanisms for flaky elements
- Use ActionChains for complex user interactions
- Generate locators that handle AJAX loading
- Include screenshot capture points for debugging
- Provide data-driven test parameter mapping
- Format with proper exception handling and logging

Focus on elements that load asynchronously or change state frequently.
```

**For Cypress Modern Testing:**
```
Generate Cypress commands and locators for this page:
- Use cy.get() with data-cy attributes preferably
- Include custom commands for repeated actions
- Generate intercepts for API calls
- Use proper cy.wait() strategies for dynamic content
- Include viewport and responsive testing locators
- Provide fixture data integration patterns
- Format as reusable command library

Emphasize Cypress best practices and real-world user interaction flows.
```

### Test Data Generation

```
Generate realistic test data for this form/application:
- Create valid data sets covering happy path scenarios
- Generate boundary value test cases (min/max values)
- Include negative test data (invalid formats, SQL injection attempts)
- Provide internationalization test data (Unicode, RTL languages)
- Generate accessibility testing data (screen reader compatibility)
- Create performance test data (large datasets, stress testing)
- Format as JSON/CSV/database seed files

Include both positive and negative test scenarios with expected outcomes.
```

### E-commerce Automation Scenarios

#### Smart Amazon Purchase Automation
```
Automate Amazon purchase with intelligent decision making:
- Search for "e-gift card" and filter by denomination options
- Select Rs 3500 gift card with highest ratings and verified seller
- Add to cart and immediately proceed to "Buy Now" to bypass cart conflicts
- Navigate to checkout and verify delivery/billing addresses
- Select SBI card as payment method with secure handling
- Fill payment details but PAUSE at OTP verification step
- Implement screenshot capture and notification system for OTP prompt
- Include error handling for out-of-stock, price changes, or payment failures
- Log all steps with timestamps for audit trail

Safety measures: Include price verification, seller validation, and purchase confirmation before payment.
