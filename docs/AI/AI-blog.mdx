## 🛠️ Practical AI Implementation

### 1. Smart Test Case Generation

```python title="AI-Powered Test Case Generator Example"
import openai
from typing import List, Dict

class AITestGenerator:
    def __init__(self, api_key: str):
        openai.api_key = api_key
    
    def generate_test_cases(self, requirements: str) -> List[Dict]:
        """Generate test cases using AI based on requirements"""
        prompt = f"""
        Generate comprehensive test cases for the following requirement:
        {requirements}
        
        Include positive, negative, and edge cases.
        Format as JSON with test_name, description, steps, and expected_result.
        """
        
        response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model="gpt-4",
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
            temperature=0.3
        )
        
        return self.parse_test_cases(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### 2. Self-Healing Test Scripts

<Admonition type="note" title="Self-Healing Automation">
AI-powered self-healing tests can automatically adapt to UI changes, reducing maintenance overhead by up to 80%.
</Admonition>

```javascript title="Self-Healing Selenium Example"
// Using Testim's self-healing capabilities
const { Builder, By, until } = require('selenium-webdriver');
const { TestimSDK } = require('@testim/testim-sdk');

class SelfHealingTest {
    constructor() {
        this.driver = new Builder().forBrowser('chrome').build();
        this.testim = new TestimSDK({
            token: 'your-testim-token',
            project: 'your-project-id'
        });
    }
    
    async smartClick(elementDescription) {
        // AI-powered element identification
        const element = await this.testim.findElement({
            description: elementDescription,
            fallbackStrategies: ['xpath', 'css', 'text', 'visual']
        });
        
        await element.click();
    }
}
```
